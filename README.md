# Generation-of-Engineers
  ## Description

  This web application will provide prompts on the command line for the user to answer and generate a html with thier team information. This project was difficult but also rewarding. Currently, working to generate the full content of the html file from index.js file. I plan to revisit this and have the site with a presentable UX/UI design.
